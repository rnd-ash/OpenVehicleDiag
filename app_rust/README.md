## Questions and answers

### Question
Why must I use Macchina's M2 adapter on Linux and Mac OSX?

### Answer
The J2534 diagnostic API only officially supports Windows. Therefore, all commercial J2534 devices will only have drivers for Windows.
This is why I designed a custom cross-platform J2534 driver for Macchina's M2 module so that the API can be used on UNIX based operating systems.
