Open Vehicle Diagnostics (OVD) is a Rust-based open source vehicle ECU diagnostic platform that makes use of the J2534-2 protocol.

The idea is to make diagnosing and exploring your cars diagnostics functions possible, via an API, thus allowing the ability for you to reprogram ECUâ€™s without the need for a special dealer-only tool.

This is for my University FYP for my degree at the University of Reading

## IMPORTANT
If you are just here for the application and not the entire framework, check the [application folder](app_rust/)
